        Kalinga in 261 BC Its territory formed a part of the ancient Kalinga of
        Mahabharat fame. Ashok the Mauryan King of Magadh, invaded Kalinga in
        261 BC and this event has gone down in history as the Great Kalinga war.
        Then the people of Kalinga offered a relentless & dauntless resistance,
        but they lost at last. How desperate was the battle, how bitterly was it
        fought, and how terrible were the results, are known from Ashokâ€™s own
        descriptions. This is what he wrote about the Kalinga war in his
        thirteenth Rock Edict. The country of Kalinga was conquered when King
        Priyadarshan, beloved of the Gods had been anointed eight years. One
        hundred and fifty thousand were there from captured, one hundred
        thousand were there slain, and many times as many died. But what was the
        result? The conquered Kalinga conquered her conqueror. This was the last
        war fought by him after which he became the great champion of Buddhism
        and upheld the values of peace and non-violence. The ancient state rose
        to prominence as a Kingdom under Kharavela , a great conquerer and
        patron of Jainism, in the second half of the Ist century B.C. Other
        great rulers belonged to the Keshari dynasty and the Eastern Ganga
        dynasty who were also great builders.
