    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      Virender Sehwag has constructed an extraordinary
      <b><i>16 years</i></b> lasting career with a relentless quest, and a
      genius, for boundary hitting.<br />
      With minimal footwork but maximum intent, he has piled Test runs at a
      faster pace than anyone in the history of cricket.<br />
      Bowlers must always fancy their chances against a batsman who plays so
      many strokes; it's just that Sehwag fancies his chances against them much
      more.

    <h2>Domestic Career</h2>
    <p>
      His uncomplicated approach - batting is all about scoring as many runs as
      quickly as possible - <br />
      belies a sharp and street-smart cricket mind. He has a keen grasp of his
      own, and his opponents', <br />
      strengths and weaknesses and exploits them in a forensic manner. What
      appears risky to many, is merely an <br />
      opportunity for him, and his lack of footwork, which does get him in
      trouble against the moving ball, <br />
      is mostly an advantage, for it creates space for his brilliant handwork.
      Few batsmen have hit the ball harder square on the off side.
